# GuideBot-Campus-AI-Assistant-For-GIU

#### Bugs and New Implementations

- [X] Add a voice response when something is blocking its way.
- [X] Train the NLP model to understand from my responses where it should go based on commands. For example, when asked about financial matters, it will suggest going to the financial room. Similarly, for course-related inquiries, like adding or dropping courses, it will suggest the student affairs room, and for admission-related topics, such as applying for university, it will suggest the admissions room. For each scenario, the bot should first check if the relevant room is open before guiding the user to it.
- [X] Adding responses for Hi, Hey and so on.
- [ ] Fixing the problem if i only said the room name does not take me to it like "M215".
